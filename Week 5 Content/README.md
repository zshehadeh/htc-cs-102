# Classes and Constructors Practice
## Review MovieList
Give the students access to the basic [MovieList Solution](../Constructors/MovieList/) from the previous lesson. They should have built something similar in the previous lesson, but they should all get a chance to start fresh if they so choose.

Use the existing solution to review class concepts and WPF concepts.

## FollowAlong: Build to MovieListExercises
Add in a ListView and show how it can reflect the collection of movies. Do this as a class so that the students have an idea of how it works. Additionally, add a double click event to the ListView so that each row will show details about the movie when clicked. The completed version for this FollowAlong is [MovieListExercises](MovieListExercises/).

## Individual Exercises
A few challenging exercises for the students to work on individually. They will make updates to the existing Movie List application. Instructions for these exercises are in [MovieListExercises.md](MovieListExercises.md).

## Solutions
- [MovieList](../Constructors/MovieList/) - Starting point for follow-along, from [Constructors](../Constructors/) lesson
- [MovieListExercises](MovieListExercises/) - Complete version, after follow-along
