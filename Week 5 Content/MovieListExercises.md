# Movie List Exercises
## 1. Rotten Tomatoes
Add a field for "Rotten Tomatoes Score" and store that in the Movie object along with the other values.
- The text box and label should be added to the User Interface
- The field should be of type `double` because it represents a percentage
- When field should be initialized within the constructor
- The score should be added to the `ShowDetails` method

## 2. Duplicate Movies
Prevent the user from adding a movie with a title that already exists in the list. If the movie title is a duplicate, show a message to the user saying it cannot be added.

## 3. Error Handling
Add in proper error handling for numeric (`int` and `double`) fields when "Add" is clicked.
- If the user does not enter a number for the numeric fields, display a message to the user saying there was an error, and prevent the movie from being added to the list
- If the movie is added successfully, display a message to the user saying it was added

## 4. CHALLENGE - Release Date
Instead of storing the Release Year for a movie, store the Release Date using a `DateTime` type. Use a `DatePicker` in the User Interface to allow the user to select a date.
- Update the `ReleaseYear` field in the `Movie` class:
    - Change the name to `ReleaseDate`
    - Change the type to `Date`

Add a field for "Genre" and store that in the Movie object along with the other values.
- The text box and label should be added to the User Interface
- The field should be of type `string`
